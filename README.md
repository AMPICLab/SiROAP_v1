# SiROAPv1

(c) Vishal Saxena, 2022

This is a work in progress and not for public use. 

## Installation
Copy the files and install the dependencies (PhotonTorch). GUI will neet some QT libraries to be installed.

## Things to Do:

1. Do a better job of handling I/O ports in the array, it's confusing and error-prone as of now.

2. Add a Thermal crosstalk model to the array. Change the simulator to simulate thermal crosstalk.

3. Add code for thermal crosstalk estimation and mitigation.

The code uses phase for the BTUs instead of using DAC power. However, it may not be an issue unless electrical nonidealities need to be modeled.

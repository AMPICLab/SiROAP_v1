# SiROAPv1

(c) Vishal Saxena, 2022

This is a work in progress and not for public use. 

## Installation
Copy the files and install the dependencies (PhotonTorch). GUI will neet some QT libraries to be installed.

## Things to Do:

1. Do a better job of handling I/O ports in the array, its confusing and error prone as of now.

2. Add random offsets in the BTUs

3. Add a Thermal crosstalk model to the array. Change simulator to simulate with thermal crosstalk.

4. Add code for thermal crosstalk estimation and mitigation
